# Personalized Medical Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based web application that recommends appropriate medicines based on a patient's symptoms and personal details such as age and gender.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input symptoms and patient details
- Machine learning model trained on medical data
- Medicine recommendation based on diagnosis
- Backend built with Flask (or FastAPI)
- Frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React)
- Modular structure for scalability

## Folder Structure


## How It Works

1. The user enters basic information and symptoms on the frontend.
2. The frontend sends this data to the backend via API.
3. The backend uses a trained ML model to predict the diagnosis and recommend a medicine.
4. The result is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
